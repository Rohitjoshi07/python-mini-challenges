### Project Overview

 This project consists of a bunch of small python projects which help to clear all the basic and tricky concepts of python.
In this project, I used to create some functions which can help us to find something very easily. Some of them are:
Fibonacci finder
complex calculator
etc


### Learnings from the project

 After compleating this project I had a good practice in python syntax and some tricky concepts. This project gives me some tough but tricky challenges that makes to learn better and approach the problem in a different way.



### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The approach is the same as I used in all the problems that divide the problem in steps then solve them to get the final output. The use of algorithms helps to fetch the output in an efficient manner.


### Challenges faced

 The challenges I faced in these problems is basically how to make my code efficient and less memory consumable. Sometimes the syntax and tricks used to solve the problem gave me a hard time but in the end, I cracked it.
